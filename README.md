# Invoice-Generator
This is an opensource free invoice generator to make it easier on me in particular to create invoices for my clients.

To download and start using just downoad the Release.zip and export it where ever you wish. Within the release folder, there is a file
called "InvoiceGenerator.exe" I would recomend creating a shortcut from this file on your desktop somewhere.

The first launch on the program will require you to fill out client and contractor information, there is no way modifying 
this info at this time.
NOTE: If you needed to modify this information it is stored in a '.json' file under '[user]\Documents\InvoiceGenerator\'.

Once you start adding work items they can be removed by clicking on them. (To be replaced with a confirm removal dialogue.)
To add time to a work log simply type the same name into the work description. 

Once done click 'Export PDF' at the top left corner to export it as an invoice formated PDF. 

To note would be that the invoice number is dependant on how many invoices already exist in the invoices folder.
You may need to manually modify specific pieces of information within.
