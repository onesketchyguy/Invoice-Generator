# Invoice-Generator
This is an opensource free invoice generator to make it easier on me in particular to create invoices for my clients.

To download and start using just downoad the Release.zip and export it where ever you wish. Within the release folder, there is a file called "InvoiceGenerator.exe" I would recomend creating a shortcut from this file on your desktop somewhere.

The first launch on the program will require you to fill out client and contractor information, you can modify this info at any time by clicking 'Change billing info'.
NOTE: This information is stored in a '.json' file under '[user]\Documents\InvoiceGenerator\'.

Once you start adding work items they can be removed by clicking on them, them clicking delete.
To add time to a work log simply type the same name into the work description. Alternatively, you can click on the item to set the description text to that items text.

If you don't need to export your work yet, but you just want to remember what you've done, you can simply close the app and be done. The application will automatically save your progress. But if you're untrusting(like me) then you can click 'Save current work items' to make sure that the app saves your current progress.

If you made a mistake, then at the moment there is no CTRL+Z, however you can click on that 'Load last work items' button, and load your most recent save.
NOTE: This does not apply to the billing info, if you screw that up, you're SOL.

Once done click 'Export PDF' at the top left corner to export it as an invoice formated PDF. 

To note would be that the invoice number is dependant on how many invoices already exist in the invoices folder.
You may need to manually modify specific pieces of information within.
